            Our current Agriculture system burns large amounts of fossil fuels
            to manufacture fertilizers and run agricultural machinery. But its
            not just burning fossil fuels that create GHG like C02 in
            agriculture. Methane (CH4)is generated from grazing cows, beef
            cattle and sheep Nitrous oxide is generated when applying
            synthetically made nitrogen fertilizers to the soil. And the living
            organisms in the soil can die, releasing carbon dioxide into the
            atmosphere

            The region around Pukekohe and the Bombay Hills is where much of
            Auckland’s food is grown. The soils are free-draining volcanic silt.
            Tractors can drive onto the soil without “compacting” it for most of
            the year. The North Shore area has not been a food producing area
            because the soils have a high clay content meaning the soil compacts
            easily. Compacted soil is dead soil because air and water cannot
            move freely through it.
          </BodyText>
          <BodyText>
            The City to Farm Local Food Resilience Composting Project changes
            compacted clay soil into freer draining soil. Here is a “before”
            picture of the soil on the Graingers farm. A healthy soil would be
            dark brown and easy to dig into. This white clay soil is hard and
            difficult to dig into.

            Ancient people from around the world have learned to how to modify
            their clay soils to grow crops. Modern science is just now
            discovering how this was done. One of the best examples of how
            ancient people changed clay soil into productive soil was in the
            Amazon River Basin in Brazil. The Amazonian people somehow added
            inoculated charcoal to change its soil structure.

            In the 1500’s Portuguese explorers described great white cities
            built along the Amazon River. But later explorers could only find
            jungle in the places these cities were said to be. In the 1970’s
            anthropologists and archaeologists examined these sites and found
            evidence of deep, rich agricultural soils that had been man-made.
          </BodyText>
          <BodyText>
            The extent of these black, rich, man-made soils is so vast that the
            scientists reckon the Amazon Basin could have been home to over 10
            million people. These rich, fertile, black soils were often a metre
            deep. The Brazilians call them Terra Preta, meaning “Black Earth” in
            Portuguese

          <BodyText>
            Today in the Amazon, the rain forests are being cut down and burned
            for agriculture that is productive only a few years. This is called
            “slash and burn” and is a highly destructive form agriculture as the
            soil quickly loses its fertility and the jungle struggles to regrow.

          <TextHeader>Terra Preta Agriculture</TextHeader>
          <BodyText>
            However, the Terra Preta soils made by ancient peoples over 500
            years ago have maintained their soil fertility and are still used
            today to grow healthy crops. How did they do it?

            Modern soil scientists have found topsoil will naturally develop
            slowly over time if 3 things are done together: Minimum Soil
            Disturbance The soil is not deeply turned over, ploughed or dug
            Permanent Soil Cover The soil is always growing something, or
            mulched Diversified Cropping The soil is always growing a diversity
            of crops, not a monoculture The City to Farm Composting Project does
            all this
          </BodyText>
          <TextHeader>Slow Topsoil Building</TextHeader>
          <BodyText>
            Together these promote a flourishing, diverse ecology of soil
            micro-organisms which slowly builds topsoil

          <BodyText>
            But now soil scientists are adding AMF, biochar, food scraps, SMOs
            and avoiding chemical fertilizer. They are finding topsoil forms
            very quickly and seems to last for a much longer time. The City to
            Farm Composting Project does all of these activities, too. Together,
            these 7 farming practices should grow a very stable form of topsoil
            that contains “glomalin” which can last in the soil for hundreds,
            maybe thousands of years– storing carbon from the atmosphere at a
            greater rate than growing forests. Perhaps this is how Terra Preta
            is formed. This is what the City to Farm Composting project is
            about— growing soils with stable carbon and good soil structure

          <TextHeader>How the City to Farm Composting System Works</TextHeader>
          <BodyText>
            The goal is to re-create the soils, the diversity and productivity
            of our native forests, but using trees and shrubs that produce food
            for us. This type of food production system is called a Food Forest
            or Forest Garden and is a common concept in Permaculture.

            Swales Swales are dug on the contour. This captures rainwater and
            traps it so it soak into the ground instead of running off

            Biochar Biochar (charcoal made from natural, non-toxic materials
            that would normally go into landfill or be burned) is dug into the
            bottom which acts as to loosen the heavy clay and make it free-
            draining. Biochar also acts as a permanent form of compost in the
            soil, holding onto water and nutrients.

            A Food Forest is fed with Bokashi-ed Food Scraps 1. Food scraps are
            properly layered with bokashi micro –organisms and tamped down. Food
            scraps are high in nitrogen, complex carbohydrates, proteins and
            many minerals, necessary to feed a diversity of SMOs 2. In the
            bottom of the bucket or wheelie bin there is a layer of woody mulch.
            This adds carbon in the form of cellulose and lignin, another food
            for micro-organisms. It also keeps the food scraps out of the liquid
            that forms when food scraps break down 3. In the bottom of the
            bucket or wheelie bin there is biochar. In the liquid leachate, the
            biochar becomes “charged” and “inoculated” by the micro-organisms
            bokashi zing and nutrients from the breakdown of the food scraps 4.
            An air-tight lid is fitted when the bucket is full and taken to the
            collection point

            Composting kick -starts the soil building process but plants and the
            soil micro - organisms (SMOs) continue to develop into soil. Soil
            grows as soil micro -organisms populations grow.
            <ol>
              <li>
                Biochar seems to form a permanent home for micro -organisms to
                live in so the SMOs live in the soil permanently
              </li>
              <li>
                Through the photosynthesis, plants pump starches and sugars down
                through their roots to feed and create a complex soil ecology.
                This great diversity of soil micro -organisms is necessary
                support a special type of beneficial fungus
              </li>
              <li>
                This beneficial fungus, called arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus
                (AMF) turn starches and sugars made by the plant into fungus
                tubes, called glomalin, which form a very stable form of carbon.
              </li>
            </ol>
            1. 2. 3. 3. But this AMF seems to need a “climax ecosystem” of micro
            -organisms. When it exists, glomalin in the soil increases. Glomalin
            can stay in the soil for hundreds, maybe thousands of years.
          </BodyText>
          <BodyText>
            Building topsoil could mitigate Climate Change The build up of
            glomalin is natures way of sequestering carbon in the soil for a
            long time. When plants take carbon out of the atmosphere and store
            it in the form of glomalin, there is the potential to reverse
            climate change. Somehow, biochar helps this process as it is a
            unique ingredient in Terra Preta. Carbon stored as glomalin is
            released back into the SMOs are killed—this can happen if the soil
            is deeply plowed, surface plants are killed, or chemical fertilizers
            added. All of these kill the complex ecology of SMOs known as the
            the soil food web.

            We are all looking for innovative, regenerative ways to create new
            jobs that improve our environment. The City to Farm Project (C2F)
            employs local people and creates true wealth—healthy local soils on
            local farms capable of producing high quality food and fibre. The
            C2F Project takes urban food scraps and takes them to a local farm
            for composting. Using a unique, 4-step composting process poor clay
            soils are transformed into rich, prime agricultural land. Besides
            improving local soils, and growing valuable crops, there is also
            potential for local rural property owners to qualify for carbon
            credits by sequestering carbon through topsoil building. Here is a
            project that is a win-win-win for creating local employment,
            improving our local food supply, improving our local farm
            environment, and reversing climate change.
          </BodyText>
          <BodyText>
            The C2F project seeks households and businesses who want to do the
            right thing and stop using their garbage disposals and insinkerators
            and instead bring food scraps to the WCRC. Buckets for food scraps
            can be picked up and dropped off at the WCRC for a small charge. Or,
            for large amounts of food scraps, The C2F box truck can come by and
            collect wheelie bins directly. For more information about how it
            works click here.
