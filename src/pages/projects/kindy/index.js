The Facilitators work with Kindy staff about possibilities to reduce or eliminate these.  Together, a custom-made plan specifically for each Kindy is mapped out. The Facilitators then spend up to 4 months working with the ECEs to fulfil their zero-waste plan." />
          <BodyText text="Currently the program is free due to generosity of funding from the for-Hibiscus Bays Local Board.  Plans are afoot to expand the program into Upper Harbour Local Board and embed the concept of kitiakitanga to establish the Kiwi values of environmental stewardship at an early age.  The project is administered through a charitable environmental trustâ€”Hibiscus Coast Zero Waste.   The Trained facilitators are Joanne Smart and Judith Rosamund. " />
